## CAFE MENU PROJECT

# Project Background
The client has launched a pop-up caf√© in a busy business district. They
are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding
offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to
log and track orders.

# Project requirements:
I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.
- When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the system.
- I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing, out-for-delivery, delivered.
- When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
- When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.
- I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.
- I need to receive regular software updates.

# How they were met:
- Program maintains a collection of:
    1. Products (Product **name** and **price**)
    2. Couriers (Courier **name** and **phone number**)
    3. Orders (Customer **name**, **address**, **phone number**, **assigned courier**, **order status** and ordered **items**)
- All data can be **updated.**
- All data is **loaded** from the database upon program start.
- All data is **saved** to the database upon program exit and when data is created/updated/removed.
- Data can optionally be **exported** from or **imported** to csv.
- A log of database transactions is **saved** into a text file.
- Application has been throughly **tested** (90+ unit tests implemented).

# Action plan for future
- Visualise data with matplotlib/jupyter.
- Refactor old code (particularly earlier tests) to be in line with recent code.

# What I enjoyed
- The problem solving aspect of figuring out how to meet project requirements within a Python program.
- Learning about unit testing while implementing it.
- That feeling when your code finally runs with no errors.
